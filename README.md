# The random generator generator

Hello human!

This tool helps you create **generative grammars**.

You can use it to make funny sentences, semi-sensical stories, abstract poetry, idea generators or whatever floats your boat :)

### How to preview this on your computer

You just double-click `index.html` in your browser, right? Unfortunately, your browser doesn't have access to all your files by default, so this won't work.

You will need to start a _web server_ on the folder where this project lives (or one of its parent folders):

1. Open Terminal
2. Navigate to this project folder
3. Type `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 1983`
4. If it doesn't work, try `python3 -m http.server 1983`
5. Open your favourite browser and go to `http://localhost:1983`
